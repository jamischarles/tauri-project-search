# (Tauri based) Project search

## TODO:
- [ ] Left rail search results. Right rail: bat view of file in result. 
- [ ] Able to tab/arrow/click to cycle through the lines of each file in the right rail (preview)
- [x] post periodic screenshots of progress on the readme of the UI 
- [x] inputs to support
  - [x] folder to search
  - [x] search string


- format output to be readable (cm6?)  Just keep it simple for now...    
(maybe we use the JSON output, then make some simple UI output...)
file + code formatting? cm6? Basic readonly one that I made?


## Later:
* allow using local binary instead of the shipped binary for rg etc...

## Current UI
